# Duplicate Letter Fest

A playful CLI tool that detects repeated characters in strings and presents them with fun, flickerâ€‘free ASCII balloon animations.

---

## Features

- **Interactive or Batch Mode**: Process a single input or multiple lines from a file.
- **Configurable Animation**: Adjust speed (`--fast`), height (`--height N`), or disable animation completely (`--no-animation`).
- **Verbose Debugging**: Enable `--verbose` to see per-character count logs.
- **Memory Profiling**: Use `--mem-profile` to display current and peak memory usage of the duplicateâ€‘finding algorithm.
- **Inâ€‘Window Summary**: After animation, a summary of input, duplicates, time, and memory stats appears in the same terminal buffer.
- **Static Type Checking**: Comprehensive type annotations with mypy validation.
- **Code Quality Tools**: Integrated Black, isort, flake8, and pre-commit hooks.
- **Automated Testing & CI**: Parameterized Pytest suite and GitHub Actions CI integration.

## Docker

You can run Duplicate Letter Fest in a Docker container without installing Python or any dependencies locally.

### Building the Docker Image

```bash
docker build -t duplicate-letter-fest .
```

### Running with Docker

#### Interactive Mode

```bash
docker run -it duplicate-letter-fest
```

#### Batch Mode (File Input)

```bash
docker run -it -v "$(pwd)/inputs.txt:/app/inputs.txt:ro" duplicate-letter-fest --input-file inputs.txt
```

#### Using Flags with Docker

All command-line flags work with Docker:

```bash
docker run -it duplicate-letter-fest --fast --height 20 --mem-profile --no-animation
```

#### Notes on Terminal Support in Docker

- The `-it` flags are essential for interactive mode and animations
- If you experience issues with animations in Docker, try the `--no-animation` flag
- For best results, ensure your terminal window is sufficiently large

---

## Usage

### Interactive Mode

Run without arguments for a prompt:

```bash
python -m src.main
```

**Example:**
```
$ python -m src.main
ðŸŽˆ Welcome to the Duplicate Letter Fest! ðŸŽˆ
Type any word or name, and watch repeated letters pop up as balloons if enabled.
Enter text: balloon
```
_(Balloons rise in your terminal, then summary appears.)_


### Batch Mode (File Input)

Prepare a text file (`inputs.txt`) with one input per line:
```
hello
banana
supercalifragilisticexpialidocious
```

Run:
```bash
python -m src.main --input-file inputs.txt
```

Outputs each result (animation or summary) in sequence.


### Flags

- `-v`, `--verbose`  : Show debug logs of histogram counts
- `--fast`           : Decrease animation delay for faster floats
- `--height N`       : Set number of animation steps (default: 12)
- `--no-animation`   : Skip animations and print summary only
- `--mem-profile`    : Report memory usage of the duplicateâ€‘finding step
- `--input-file FILE`: Process multiple inputs from `FILE`

**Combining Flags Example:**
```bash
python -m src.main --fast --height 20 --mem-profile -v --input-file inputs.txt
```

---

## Approach & Architecture

1. **Parsing & Configuration**: Uses `argparse` for flexible CLI options.
2. **Duplicate Detection**: Single-pass histogram with O(n) time and O(k) space (k = distinct chars). Skips whitespace.
3. **Performance Measurement**:
   - **Time**: `time.perf_counter()` around the core algorithm.
   - **Memory**: `tracemalloc` to capture current and peak usage if requested.
4. **Terminal Animation**:
   - Built with Python's `curses` library for flickerâ€‘free rendering.
   - Evenly divides terminal width into slots to prevent balloon overlap.
   - Balloons rise over specified height and speed.
   - After animation, renders a summary in the same window.
5. **Type Safety**:
   - Comprehensive type annotations throughout the codebase.
   - Strict mypy configuration enforcing type checking.
6. **Code Quality**:
   - Black for consistent code formatting.
   - isort for organized imports.
   - flake8 for code linting and style checking.
   - pre-commit hooks to automate quality checks.
7. **Testing & CI**:
   - Parameterized tests with `pytest.mark.parametrize` for coverage.
   - CI pipeline includes test execution, type checking, and code quality verification.

## SOLID Architecture

The project implements SOLID principles for better maintainability, testability, and extensibility:

### Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)

Each class and module has a single, well-defined responsibility:

- **DuplicateFinder**: Focuses solely on finding duplicate characters
- **Visualizer**: Handles only the visualization of results
- **MemoryProfiler**: Manages memory tracking functionality
- **CLI Parser**: Handles command-line argument parsing
- **Result Class**: Encapsulates analysis results

### Open/Closed Principle (OCP)

Components are open for extension but closed for modification:

- New visualization methods can be added by implementing the `Visualizer` interface
- Different duplicate detection algorithms can extend the `DuplicateFinder` class
- Core functionality doesn't need to change to accommodate new features

### Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)

All implementations can be substituted for their abstract base classes:

- `BalloonVisualizer` and `NoAnimationVisualizer` can be used interchangeably
- The high-level code doesn't need to know which specific implementation is being used

### Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)

Interfaces are focused and minimal:

- `Visualizer` interface has only what visualizers need
- `DuplicateFinder` interface focuses only on duplicate finding functionality
- No client is forced to depend on methods it doesn't use

### Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)

High-level modules depend on abstractions, not concrete implementations:

- `process_input()` accepts interfaces rather than concrete classes
- Dependencies are injected rather than created internally
- Components are loosely coupled through interfaces

### Project Structure

The refactored code is organized into logical modules:

```
src/
â”œâ”€â”€ __init__.py
â”œâ”€â”€ main.py                  # Entry point
â”œâ”€â”€ cli/                     # Command-line interface
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ __init__.py
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ parser.py            # Command-line argument parsing
â”œâ”€â”€ core/                    # Core functionality
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ __init__.py
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ duplicate_finder.py  # Duplicate detection logic
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ result.py            # Result data structures
â”œâ”€â”€ profiling/               # Performance measurement
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ __init__.py
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ memory_profiler.py   # Memory profiling functionality
â””â”€â”€ ui/                      # User interface
    â”œâ”€â”€ __init__.py
    â”œâ”€â”€ summary.py           # Visualization interfaces for the Duplicate Letter Fest application.
    â”œâ”€â”€ visualizer.py        # Visualization interface
    â””â”€â”€ balloon_viz.py       # Balloon visualization implementations
```

### Benefits of This Architecture

1. **Improved testability**: Each component can be tested in isolation
2. **Better maintainability**: Smaller, focused classes are easier to understand and modify
3. **Enhanced extensibility**: New features can be added with minimal changes to existing code
4. **Reduced coupling**: Components interact through abstractions, not direct dependencies
5. **Clear separation of concerns**: Each part of the system has a well-defined responsibility

## Type Safety

This project implements robust type safety using Python's type annotation system:

- **Full Type Annotations**: All functions and methods are properly typed
- **Custom Type Aliases**: Specialized types like `CursesWindow` improve readability
- **Mypy Configuration**: Strict settings in `mypy.ini` enforce type safety
- **CI Integration**: Continuous type checking in GitHub Actions

To run type checking locally:

```bash
mypy src
```

## Code Quality Tools

The project uses the following tools to ensure code quality:

### Black

# Check formatting without modifying
black --check .
```

### isort

Sorts imports alphabetically and automatically separated into sections.

```bash
# Sort imports
isort .

# Check import sorting
isort --check .
```

### flake8

```bash
# Lint code
flake8 .
```

### pre-commit

Runs quality checks before each commit to maintain high standards.

```bash
# Run on staged files
pre-commit run

# Run on all files
pre-commit run --all-files
```
